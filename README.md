## How it Work

FashionGPT uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model as a feature extractor to analyze the visual aspects of a user's selected image. It then compares the extracted features with a database of product images to find the most visually similar items. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed to identify the top matching products based on their similarity scores. Users can choose to display the original image alongside the recommendations for easy comparison and can adjust the number of recommendations displayed. Additional product information and color palettes are also available for each recommendation.

VirgilAblohGPT (https://github.com/knowrohit/virgilablohGPT)  enhances the experience by offering fashion-related conversations and recommendations. Powered by ChatGLM-6b, the chatbot provides information on fashion topics, engages in discussions, and assists with various fashion-related tasks. Users can choose from a range of topics, such as summer fashion, winter trends, vintage style, street style, workout gear, accessories, sustainable fashion, latest fashion tech, fashion influencers, personal styling tips, and dress codes. They can also select specific tasks like coding, summarization, emotion detection, friendship, education, humor, storytelling, translation, writing, fact-checking, advice, forecast, analysis, brainstorming, negotiation, and motivation, each tailored to provide unique responses.
